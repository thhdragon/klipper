## Prohibited Approaches
- Do not create Klipper documentation or tutorials
- Avoid language specific to Klipper's architecture
- Do not focus on configuration file syntax or specific APIs
- Avoid memorization-based content

## Success Criteria
Your dataset should enable an LLM to:
1. Reason through novel 3D printing control challenges
2. Apply universal principles to different printer architectures
3. Design safety systems and error handling logic
4. Optimize performance while maintaining reliability
5. Handle edge cases and failure scenarios gracefully

## Example Extended Reasoning Entry

**Control System Problem**: 
Design an adaptive bed leveling algorithm that maintains print quality while minimizing calibration time, accounting for thermal expansion and mechanical backlash.

**Physical Context & Constraints**:
- Probe accuracy: ±0.01mm with 0.5s measurement time per point
- Bed surface deformation: up to 0.2mm across 220×220mm print area  
- Thermal expansion: ~0.1mm variation during 30°C temperature swing
- Mechanical backlash: ±0.05mm in Z-axis positioning
- Real-time constraint: recalibration must complete within 90 seconds

**Mathematical Analysis**:
Let me work through this systematically to find the optimal probe strategy...

Step 1: Surface modeling with measurement uncertainty
The bed surface can be modeled as a polynomial: z(x,y) = Σ aᵢⱼxⁱyʲ
Given measurement noise σ = ±0.01mm, we need at least n points where:
measurement_error² + interpolation_error² ≤ (0.05mm)²

Step 2: Optimal probe point placement using D-optimal design
To minimize interpolation error, probe points should maximize the determinant of the information matrix. For a 3×3 grid, this gives us points at:
(x,y) = {(±110, ±110), (0, ±110), (±110, 0), (0,0)}

Step 3: Real-time constraint optimization
With 0.5s per measurement × 9 points = 4.5s base time
Adding movement time: t_total = 4.5s + Σ(distance_i / feedrate)
We can reduce this by 40% using a optimized probe sequence...

**Rust Implementation Strategy**:
```rust
use nalgebra::Matrix3;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
struct ProbePoint {
    position: Vector2<f32>,
    measured_height: f32,
    measurement_error: f32,
    timestamp: std::time::Instant,
}

// Const generics enforce grid size at compile time
struct BedLevelingController<const GRID_SIZE: usize> {
    probe_points: [Option<ProbePoint>; GRID_SIZE],
    surface_model: SurfaceModel,
}

impl<const GRID_SIZE: usize> BedLevelingController<GRID_SIZE> {
    fn adaptive_probe(&mut self) -> Result<CompensationMesh, CalibrationError> {
        // Ownership ensures probe data integrity - no concurrent modification
        let mut probe_sequence = self.calculate_optimal_sequence()?;
        
        for point in probe_sequence.drain(..) {
            // Rust prevents us from using stale probe data through borrowing rules
            let measurement = self.probe_at_position(point.position)?;
            self.update_surface_model(measurement);
            
            // Early termination if convergence reached
            if self.surface_error_estimate() < 0.05 {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        Ok(self.generate_compensation_mesh())
    }
}
```

**Safety Verification**:
We can prove this approach maintains print quality because:
1. Interpolation error ≤ 0.05mm with 95% confidence (proven via Gaussian process bounds)
2. Rust's ownership system prevents using invalidated probe data after thermal drift
3. Const generics ensure grid size matches allocated memory at compile time

**Edge Case Analysis**:
Consider thermal expansion during long prints:
- Mathematical bounds: |∂z/∂T| ≤ 0.003mm/°C over aluminum bed
- Rust safety: ProbePoint.timestamp prevents using measurements older than thermal time constant  
- Hardware reality: If temperature change > 5°C, trigger automatic recalibration

**Alternative Approaches & Trade-offs**:
We could use continuous mesh refinement instead of fixed grids, but this adds complexity without significant quality improvement for typical print geometries. The fixed-grid approach with adaptive early termination provides the best balance of simplicity, speed, and accuracy for our constraints.

Begin your analysis by identifying the most critical control systems in Klipper's codebase and extracting the fundamental reasoning patterns that make them effective.
